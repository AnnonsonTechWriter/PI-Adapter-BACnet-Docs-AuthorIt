# Administration

With the OSIsoft adapter administration level functions, you can start and stop an adapter and the ingress component. You can also retrieve product version information and delete an adapter.

The examples in the administration topics use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. You can also configure OSIsoft adapters with the EdgeCmd utility. For more information, see [EdgeCmd utility](https://osisoft.github.io/OSIsoft-Adapter-Modbus-Docs/V1/edgecmd/V1/EdgeCmd%20utility/EdgeCmd%20utility.html). To validate successful configurations, you can accomplish data retrieval steps (GET commands) using a browser, if available on your device.

For more information on OSIsoft adapter configuration tools, see [Configuration tools](https://osisoft.github.io/OSIsoft-Adapter-Modbus-Docs/V1/main/V1/Configuration/Configuration%20tools.html).
