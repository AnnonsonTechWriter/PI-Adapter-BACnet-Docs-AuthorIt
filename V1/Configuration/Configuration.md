# Configuration

OSIsoft Adapter for BACnet provides configuration of data source and data selection. The adapter also provides configuration of security and the ability to generate a data selection file instead of manual configuration.

The examples in the configuration topics use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. The adapter can be configured with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls, or with the EdgeCmd utility. For more information, see [EdgeCmd utility](xref:EdgeCmdUtility). To validate successful configurations, you can perform data retrieval (GET commands) using a browser, if available on your device.

For more information on OSIsoft adapter configuration tools, see [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools).
